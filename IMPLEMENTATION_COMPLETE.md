## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock pillow pre-commit
```

### Step 2: Setup Hooks
```bash
# Windows
.\scripts\install-hooks.bat

# macOS/Linux
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works
```bash
pytest -v
# Should see: 93 passed in ~2s
```

**Done!** Your pre-push hooks are now active.

## 🎣 How Pre-Push Hooks Work

Every time you `git push`, tests run automatically:

✅ **Pass** → Code is pushed
❌ **Fail** → Push is blocked until you fix the tests

### Example Output
```
$ git push origin main

🧪 Running pre-push checks...

======================= 93 passed in 2.14s =======================
Coverage: 52%

✅ All tests passed! Proceeding with push.
```
